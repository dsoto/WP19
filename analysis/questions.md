# What is the marginal cost to provide diesel microgrid power?

- [x] What is the hourly power profile for times when electricity is being delivered?
- [x] Does the microgrid load vary over the course of the evening?
- [x] What is the load factor for the grids during operation?
- [x] Is the peak and average load well matched to the microgrid gensets?
- [x] What are the expected fuel rates of the generators?
- [x] Based on the load and expected fuel rates, what marginal cost per kWh or kVAh is being paid?
- [ ] What is the observed fuel consumption in the microgrid generators?
- [ ] Based on the load and observed fuel consumption, what marginal cost per kWh or kVAh is being paid?
- [ ] Based on the load, what is the per household cost?
- [ ] Are these marginal costs greater than the tariffs being charged?
- [ ] Does excessive diesel cost constrain the operation of these grids?
- [ ] How much does the observed fuel consumption deviate from the expected?
- [ ] Based on Ayapo at 60 liters per night, what energy cost do we observe from kWh per night?
- [ ] What does the survey data report on microgrid costs?
- [ ] How much energy is being delivered on the days the microgrids run?

# How reliable are the microgrids?

- [x] How many hours per day are the microgrids available?
- [x] What is the probability of grid availability per hour?
- [x] What is the cumulative probability of a certain number of service hours each day?
- [ ] How much does the microgrid performance deviate from the promised schedule?
- [ ] Why does the microgrid deviate from the promised schedule?

# Data Integrity

- [ ] Is there a way to get fine grained kW values instead of kVA?
- [ ] What anomalies should we look for in the kVA data?
- [ ] Does the kWh export match the kVA?
- [ ] Does the kWh export match the product of current and voltage?
- [ ] What anomalies exist in the kWh export data?

# Context

- Is the share of diesel installations increasing or decreasing?
- What marginal diesel cost are providers and installers assuming?
- What is the carbon intensity of this diesel power?
