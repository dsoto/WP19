# What is the marginal cost to provide diesel microgrid power?

- [x] Is the peak and average load well matched to the microgrid gensets?
    - No.  The average load is 6 - 32 percent of the rated load.
- [x] What are the expected fuel rates of the generators?
- [x] Based on the load and expected fuel rates, what marginal cost per kWh or kVAh is being paid?
    - As-new generators meeting the published specifications with the observed low loads have median marginal costs ranging from 30 cents to 60 cents per kVA-hour.
- [x] What is the observed fuel consumption in the microgrid generators?
    - Atamali observes 30 liters per night of operation
- [x] Based on the load and observed fuel consumption, what marginal cost per kWh or kVAh is being paid?
    - Based on fuel refill logs, the cost per kVAh in one villages is $2 per kVAh.
- [x] Are these marginal costs greater than the tariffs being charged?
    - No.  Reported tariffs are about 5 cents per kWh.
- [x] How much energy is being delivered on the days the microgrids run?
- [ ] How much does the observed fuel consumption deviate from the expected for a new genset?
- [ ] Based on the load, what is the per household cost?
- [ ] Does excessive diesel cost constrain the operation of these grids?
- [ ] What is the carbon intensity of this diesel power?

# How reliable are the microgrids?

- [x] What is the hourly power profile for times when electricity is being delivered?
    - The grids are not run during the day.
- [x] Does the microgrid load vary over the course of the evening?
    - Consumption is fairly flat over the evening when running.
- [x] How many hours per day are the microgrids available?
- [x] What is the probability of grid availability per hour?
- [x] What is the cumulative probability of a certain number of service hours each day?
- [ ] How much does the microgrid schedule deviate from the promised schedule?

# Data Integrity

- [x] What percentage of data have time series observations?
    - From 9 to 23 percent
- [x] What percentage of the data have observations including the on/off messages?
    - From 86 to 93 percent
- [ ] How do the gaps in the data affect the integrity of the daily energy statistics?
- [ ] How do the gaps in the data affect the integrity of the power statistics?
- [ ] Does the kWh export match the kVA?
- [ ] Does the kWh export match the product of current and voltage?
- [ ] Did the kWh export require any interpolation or data elimination?

# Context

- [ ] What is are the relative percentages of solar, wind, and diesel for off-grid deployments?  world wide?  indo?
- [ ] Is the share of diesel installations increasing or decreasing?
- [ ] What marginal diesel cost are providers and installers assuming?
