# Introduction

The electrification of the remaining 1.2 billion people without access requires a close attention to costs.
Indonesia is executing a large electrification expansion to achieve universal access [@ADB_AUEAII].
Indonesia has made significant progress reducing the number of households without electricity access over the last decades.
A significant fraction of the remaining households are beyond the reach of centralized grids and will require decentralized solutions.
Indonesian planning documents based on least-cost studies show diesel generators as a significant part of the new electricity supply [@ADB_AUEAII; @IEEFA; @RUPTL].
To ensure the delivery of electricity at the lowest price, the operating costs should be compared to assumptions over time.
If these operating costs are significantly different from the assumptions, the electrification plan should be revisited.

Previous work has shown problems with diesel generation but there are few examples of direct modeling and measurement of the fuel used per unit of electricity delivered (specific fuel consumption or SFC).
Grids in Haiti show problems with loads below the capacity of the generator that lead to infrequent operation over limited hours.
These problems make sustainable financial operation of the microgrids very difficult and many have fallen into disuse.
[@Schnitzer_Thesis].
A diesel microgrid in Nicaragua also runs at well below the generator rating [@Casillas_EP].
In the case of photovoltaic (PV) electricity, having components that provide more energy than is being used leads to higher costs [@Louie_ESD, @Lee].
Diesel generators that can deliver more power than is required by the customers can lead to higher fuel costs and generator degradation over time [@Hove_Tazvinga].

This study provides modeled and observed costs for diesel consumption in three microgrids in the Lake Sentani region of Indonesia.
We find that the generators are providing power well below their intended operating points.
Using a model based on the manufacturer specifications for several generators, we estimate that these generators would use 0.6 liters per kWh of electricity or above.
This is about twice the value for a well-maintained generator operating according to its specifications.
The observed fuel use reached as high as 1.9 liters per kWh suggesting serious fuel inefficiency likely due to issues of generator maintenance.

These results suggest that diesel micro-grids operating outside of centralized grid areas may not be performing to the expectations of the electricity planners.
Areas that are struggling with high costs of electricity delivery can estimate the SFC of their generators to check for degradation or insufficient loads.
These micro-grids could be retrofitted with diesel generators that are a better match to the load or with alternative electricity generation technologies.
Improving these operating costs could improve the financial viability on these existing grids and inform future electricity planning.
